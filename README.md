# links_extraction
 A tool for extracting the URLs from either of www.curlie.org or www.wikipedia.org recursively (i.e., including sub-pages).
 As it takes a very long time to extract all links of such websites, the recursive function takes a parameter called max_links responsible for stopping links extraction when their number reaches it. Its default value is 100_000 if not initialized by the user.
